# star_wars_pilots_API
A python program to interact with the Star Wars API, SWAPI (https://swapi.dev/documentation)

The program was created to take input from users of their choice of 3 Star Wars Characters and return information on whether the character is 
a pilot, what ships they piloted and the speed of the character's fastest ship. One condition for the program is that the list of characters 
given had to include Chewbacca. The program then displays the pilot information to the user and records the results in a text file.
